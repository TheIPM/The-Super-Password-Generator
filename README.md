## Description

This is the third weekly challenge for the my boot camp. This challenge involved creating a password generator, this password generator will generate a password between 8 - 128 characters. With this password generator you have the option to include special characters, numbers and capital letters in the creation of your unique passowrd.  

I intend to hopefully in the future go back to this challenge and see if I can use different Javascript codes to recreate this password generator.
