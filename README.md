## Description

This is the third weekly challenge for the my boot camp. This challenge involved creating a password generator, this password generator will generate a password between 8 - 128 characters. With this password generator you have the option to include special characters, numbers and capital letters in the creation of your unique passowrd.  

I intend to hopefully in the future go back to this challenge and see if I can use different Javascript codes to recreate this password generator.

## Usage

When using this password generator all you would have to do is press the generate password button and follow the prompts that appear on screen. The first instruction that appears on screen is to enter how long you want the password to be, and if you hit cancel it cancels the process.

Following that there is a series of questions that ask what you want the password to consist of and at least ONE of these boxes needs to be confirmed otherwise the Super Password Generator will prevent the creation of the password.
